    <div class="content">
      <h3>Pick&nbsp;#1 – Studio Nicholson Bric T‑shirt</h3>
      <p>Crafted from 100&#xA0;% fluid cotton jersey, the Bric T‑shirt is cut to a regular fit with a ribbed crew neck for a clean silhouette. The fabric feels comfortably soft yet retains its shape, making it as suited to warm‑weather streetwear as it is to layering under knits and jackets. Subtle design details—including a streamlined boxy shoulder and a cropped length with a heavyweight hem—add refinement without straying into oversized territory. Finished with a screen‑printed logo at the nape, this versatile staple deserves a place in any core wardrobe.</p>

  <section class="drop-section container">
    <img src="trousers.webp" alt="Marni Tropical Wool Trousers">
    <div class="content">
      <h3>Pick&nbsp;#2 – Marni Tropical Wool Trousers</h3>
      <p>These trousers are crafted from tropical virgin wool with a cotton/polyamide half‑lining, making them remarkably lightweight and comfortable. Their construction features a loose mid‑rise silhouette with front pleats, a horn button closure and an elasticated drawstring waist with belt loops. This design allows them to transition easily between casual and dressier settings. The breathable wool fabric remains cool in summer yet insulating in colder months, while the grey colourway offers odour‑ and wrinkle‑resistant versatility. If you prefer a tailored fit, consider sizing down.</p>

    <img src="sweater.webp" alt="Black Goat Cashmere Sweater">
    <div class="content">
      <h3>Pick&nbsp;#3 – Black&nbsp;Goat Cashmere Sweater</h3>
      <p>A cashmere sweater designed to last a lifetime, Black&nbsp;Goat delivers quality on par with esteemed Scottish luxury houses such as Johnstons of&nbsp;Elgin—at nearly a quarter of the price. Crafted from ultra‑premium, seamless cashmere, the knit is exceptionally soft, durable and refined. Offered in eight versatile colours, the “Smoke” shade stands out as my personal favourite. This sweater is the epitome of versatility, pairing effortlessly with both a dress shirt or a simple crew neck. As fall approaches, it is rare to find a classic knit that combines timeless style, premium craftsmanship and value at this price point.</p>

      <h3>Pick&nbsp;#4 – Mackage Joshua Duffle Coat</h3>
      <p>Mackage stands among the finest in wool outerwear, renowned for its signature leather trims and ability to transition seamlessly between casual and formal settings. The <em>Joshua Coat</em> is a standout from the Fall&nbsp;2024 collection—designed to deliver exceptional warmth without compromising comfort or versatility. Equally at home with chinos and a T‑shirt or tailored trousers and a dress shirt, it embodies effortless adaptability. Having worn it daily for two months, I can attest to its remarkable durability. With its heritage silhouette, precision tailoring and double‑face wool construction, the Joshua Coat is a definitive fall/winter staple and a must‑have in any modern wardrobe.</p>

      <h3>Pick&nbsp;#5 – La&nbsp;Canadienne Lyle Sneakers</h3>
